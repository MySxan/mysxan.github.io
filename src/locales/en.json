      "I’m <strong>MySxan</strong>, a sophomore at UIUC studying CS + GGIS, and an interest-driven full-stack developer and creative content creator. I put real time into UI/UX, performance, and interaction details — so an interface isn’t just presenting information, but truly engaging with the user.",
      "In both learning and creation, I’m always chasing a better version of the work, using an interdisciplinary mindset to solve problems. My work sits at the intersection of engineering and art — from web apps and tools, to visual design, illustration, and music composition. I enjoy breaking complex problems into clean, modular pieces, then refining each part until it feels “right.”",
      "Recently, I’ve been building a course-planning web app for schedule preview and optimization, along with smaller utilities that improve everyday workflows. I also create music (DnB / Progressive House / Artcore) and illustrations, and I like merging these practices into a unified creative language.",
